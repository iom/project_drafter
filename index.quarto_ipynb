        "A Multi-Agent System (MAS) is a computational framework where multiple autonomous agents interact to solve complex problems beyond the capability of individual agents. These systems are inspired by natural systems (e.g., ant colonies, human teams) and exhibit:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Autonomy: Agents operate independently with their own goals and decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Decentralization: No single point of control—coordination emerges through interaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Collaboration: Agents communicate, negotiate, or compete to achieve objectives.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Scalability: Tasks can be distributed dynamically across agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Characteristics\n",
        "\n",
        "- Agents: Can be software entities, robots, or AI models with perception, reasoning, and action capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Environment: Shared space where agents operate (virtual, physical, or hybrid).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Interaction Protocols: Rules for communication (e.g., contracts, auctions, blackboard systems).\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "- Start with workflow decomposition - map the process steps\n",
        "\n",
        "- Design agents as specialized team members with clear RACI roles\n",
        "\n",
        "- Ensure tool complementarity - no redundant capabilities\n",
        "\n",
        "- Build in review mechanisms - some agents should validate others\n",
        "\n",
        "- Maintain scalable structure - add/remove agents without disrupting flow\n",

        "The body of this document targets a technical audience. Below are all the codes so that the whole process can be reproduced and audited. This assume to use the following code within [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n",
        "\n",
        "First we need to use a virtual environment in Python development. This is essential for managing dependencies, avoiding conflicts, and ensuring reproducibility. It allows you to isolate project-specific libraries and versions, preventing interference with other projects or the global Python installation. This isolation helps maintain a clean development environment, simplifies project setup for collaborators, and enhances security by reducing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities. Overall, virtual environments provide a consistent and organized way to manage your Python projects effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Make sure to install the last [stable version of python language](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and create a dedicated python environment to have a fresh install where to manage correctly all the dependencies between packages. To specify a particular version of Python when creating a virtual environment, you can use the full path to the desired Python executable. Here is how you can do it:\n",
        "\n",
        "Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or any terminal emulator).\n",
        "\n",
        "Navigate to your project directory where you want to create the virtual environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Run the following command to create a virtual environment,here called **`.venv`**:\n",
        "\n",
        "> python -m venv .venv\n",

        "> .\\.venv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, configure visual Studio Code to use the virtual environment: Open the Command Palette using the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `Jupyter: Select Interpreter` and select the interpreter that corresponds to your newly created virtual environment: `('venv': venv)`.\n",
