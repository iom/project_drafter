A robust monitoring framework for the project should be designed, considering roles and responsibilities, data collection tools and methods, frequency of data collection, and remote monitoring protocols. The final deliverable should be a detailed monitoring plan with indicators. The monitoring plan should align with the project's logical framework and include data analysis and reporting processes, as well as mechanisms for feedback and learning.
