# Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Framework

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Success Metrics
- Accuracy rate: Measure the accuracy of the AI system in generating project proposals.
- User satisfaction score: Assess the satisfaction level of users with the AI-generated project proposals.
- Reduction in error rates: Track the reduction in errors and inconsistencies in the project proposals.
- Cost savings: Measure the cost savings achieved through the use of AI in project proposal drafting.

## Data Collection Methods and Frequency
- Automated data logging: Implement automated data logging to capture relevant data during the project proposal drafting process.
- User surveys: Conduct surveys to gather feedback from users on their experience with the AI-generated project proposals.
- Interviews: Conduct interviews with key stakeholders to gather qualitative data on the effectiveness and efficiency of the AI system.
- Data frequency: Collect data on an ongoing basis throughout the project proposal drafting process.

## Ethical Considerations in AI Evaluation
- User privacy: Ensure the protection of user privacy by anonymizing and securely storing user data.
- Data security: Implement robust data security measures to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data.
- Compliance with regulations: Adhere to relevant regulations and guidelines related to data protection and privacy.
- Informed consent: Obtain informed consent from users for the use of their data in the AI evaluation process.

## Reporting Mechanisms and Responsible Entities
- Reporting formats: Define clear reporting formats to present the M&E findings, including visualizations and narrative reports.
- Reporting frequency: Regularly report on the M&E findings to provide timely insights and facilitate decision-making.
- Channels of communication: Establish effective communication channels to share the M&E findings with relevant stakeholders.
- Responsible entities: Assign specific roles and responsibilities to individuals or teams for data collection, analysis, and reporting.

By implementing this M&E framework, we can effectively measure the performance and impact of the AI system in project proposal drafting. It will provide valuable insights for decision-making, ensure accountability, and support continuous improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in its project development processes.
