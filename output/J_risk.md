The final answer is the revised project proposal, which includes improvements to ensure clarity, alignment with donor expectations, and the inclusion of the theory of change. The proposal provides a comprehensive overview of the project, its objectives, methodology, expected outcomes, and budget. It also addresses potential challenges and mitigation strategies, as well as the roles and responsibilities of each partner. The proposal is now ready for submission to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
