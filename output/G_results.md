The potential challenges that can arise in the partnership for the project "Developing the usage of AI to improve IOM efficiency when drafting project proposals" include communication challenges, power dynamics, conflict resolution, resource allocation, and monitoring and evaluation. To address these challenges, the project should establish clear communication channels and protocols, establish a collaborative and inclusive decision-making process, have a clear conflict resolution mechanism, aim for a fair and equitable distribution of resources, and establish a common framework for monitoring and evaluation. Regular assessment of the partnership dynamics and adjustments should be made to ensure the success of the project.
